# vim-jumpmotion

Jump to anywhere in the window. A fully featured, _lightweight_ and _speedy_
alternative to `vim-easymotion` that works with _any motion_ in _all modes_ and
supports before/after actions. Batteries included.

## Why?

- Iâ€™m bored.
- `vim-easymotion` was noticeably slow in some of my use cases.
- `vim-easymotion` dies from very long lines.
- `vim-easymotion` is +10K lines and several megabytes.
